    "# Exploring Hacker News\n",

    "*Jack Kolberg-Edelbrock, MS*\n",

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [\"Hacker News Posts\" dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), I identified how posting type and posting time correlate with received comments and points. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I examined the relationship between post type and the number of comments and points received. The data show that **ask** posts receive the most comments, and **other** posts (neither **ask** nor **show**) receive the most points. I believe that the nature of **ask** and **other** posts leads to this observation. Requests for help in **ask** posts necessitates responses; the **other** category, which primarily consists of industry news and product reviews, is most likely to receive quick point-based feedback, as the content of the post is identifiable from the title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I examined how posting time-of-day influences the number of comments and points received. Here, the data show that early afternoon posts receive the most comments, although there are other, smaller comment hotspots thoughout the day. The clearest trend between number of points awarded and post time-of-day is in the **other** category. With these posts, the *number of points received is nearly independent of the posting time-of-day.* I believe this also ties back to the nature of the posts, with **other** posts being more digestible during the work day, on the bus, or even in the middle of the night. Contrast this to the the content-heavy nature of **ask** or **show** posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Overall, the nature of the post type demonstrably correlates with the number of comments and points received. **Ask** posts receive the most comments, and **other** posts receive points independent of post time-of-day.*\n",

    "## Introduction: \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Hacker News?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is an independent news site, similar to Reddit, operated by [Y combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/). The website is built on a simple posting platform with an up/down voting system and comments on posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who uses Hacker News?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News is popular in technology and start-up circles, and is regularly visited by hundreds of thousands of users daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why evaluate stories on Hacker News?\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the differences between how often different post categories (ie Ask HN, Show HN, etc.), we can gain insight into what sort of posts would generate the most visibility (though comments or aggregate votes) for our client. We can also determine if there is an opportune time of day to post on HN to maximize visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Posting categories on Hacker News\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this project, we will sort Hacker News posts into one of three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ask**: posts in which users are requesting aid with projects\n",
    "2. **Show**: posts in which users are showcasing their own projects\n",
    "3. **Other**: posts which fall into neither the ASK nor the SHOW categories\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Examine how post type and post time-of-day correlate with the number of comments and points received by a post.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "   In this project, we examined a dataset containing posting, commenting, and rating statistics from \"Hacker News.\" We addressed four questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What post category receives most comments onaverage?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask posts receive the most comments, followed by show posts, followed by other posts. I hypothesize that this is due to the very nature of ask posts requesting feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What post category receives most points on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Ask** and **Show** posts receive fewer points than **Other** posts. A brief analysis shows that the **Other** category is composed of both news stories, opinion pieces, and unlabeled \"ask\" and \"show\" posts. I hypothesize that this observation is due to the digestiblilty of the **other** category. These posts do not require in-depth understanding of another person's work, so it is easier to give a point assignment than other are inherently easier to understand than **Ask** or **Show** posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Does the number of comments on an **Ask** HN post vary with the time of day it was posted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-of-day does apper to correlate with the number of comments that are received per **Ask** HN post. Beyond a cluster of hours in the early afternoon Central US time, I do not see a particularly coherent pattern. Overall, the hour with the highest comment number per \"Ask HN\" post is 3pm Central US Time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Does the number of points awarded to posts vary with the time of day it was posted?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question revealed the surprising finding that in an average 24 hour period, the range in average in points per post versus hour was drastically lower in the **Other** category than in the **Ask** or **Show** caregories. This could reflect the broader interest that these topics have, as well as news articles being more digestible during the day than individual projects."
